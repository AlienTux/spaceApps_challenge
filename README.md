Space Apps Challenge - GTM
===================

This repo includes 2 different models designed in blender.

'nasa_logo' contains a nice design of the NASA logo to be printed in a desktop 3d printer. It also includes images of such files.

'telescope' includes the model 'telescope.blend' which is my attempt at solving the ESA 3d Printing Challenge.
